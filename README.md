I used only HTML and CSS because the file titled "Long Technical Specification" clearly states that JavaScript should NOT be used.
Today, I opened the "Short Technical Specification" for the first time and noticed that it directly contradicts the long one — it states that JavaScript should be used.
Unfortunately, I don’t have time to redo the work at this point, so I’ll stick with the original instructions.
For future projects, please avoid providing multiple technical specifications that contradict each other.
